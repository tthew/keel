# Implementation Plan — `chore/pr-230-review`

> **Branch context:** `chore/pr-230-review` is the synthesizer / PR-review-tracking branch for PR #230 (Epic 2). IP + RALPH.md commits live here; QUEUE-fix code commits land directly on `feat/epic-2-packaged-devbox` (PR #230 head) via `git -C /workspace/ralph-bmad ...` per worktree-locking workaround (RALPH.md § Gotchas).

## NOW

- [ ] **2.13 healthcheck timeout** `packages/devbox/docker-compose.yml:282`: `nc -z 127.0.0.1 2222` → `nc -z -w 2 127.0.0.1 ${KEEL_DEVBOX_SSH_PORT:-2222}`. Ref: `discussion_r3143864797`.

## QUEUE (PR #230 review fix-arc)

Sourced from <https://github.com/tthew/ralph-bmad/pull/230#issuecomment-4322595769>. One per iter; commit on `feat/epic-2-packaged-devbox`.
- [ ] **2.13 probe-domain three-site lockstep** `api.github.com` hardcoded in 3 files; add pre-commit grep asserting literal matches across `docker-compose.yml:281`, `docs/invariants/devbox-healthcheck.md`, `packages/devbox/README.md` § Healthcheck.
- [ ] **2.14 absorption-SHA reachability** Add sync-gate step `git rev-parse 5278738^{commit} >/dev/null 2>&1 || fail` to guard `docs/invariants/devbox-legacy-branch-retention.md:108-128`. Ref: `discussion_r3143866586`.
- [ ] **2.12 sshd liveness comment** Add 1-line comment at `packages/devbox/entrypoint.sh:207-211`: "Verify sshd is listening before exec'ing the operator shell."
- [ ] **2.7 arg-passthrough comment (NIT)** Brief comment near `packages/devbox/scripts/ralph-build-host.sh:90` on `"$@"` passthrough contract.

### Out-of-PR follow-ups (track elsewhere)

- 2.13 operator-workstation healthcheck smoke (mid-run service-death) → Epic 13 nightly.
- 2.18 IPv6 static CIDR fallback → revisit if egress-during-boot incidents recur.
- 2.11 manifest description drift at `invariants.manifest.ts:275` → deferred per Epic 2 close-out (SC-17).
- **Pre-existing `INV-package-test-coverage-floor` contentHash drift** (manifest declares `57555cb…`, file hashes `4d24479d…`); present at `fed3161` (iter-390) + every Epic-2 commit since. Not in 2.5b scope. Sync-gate is not yet wired to pre-commit/CI so it doesn't block; Story 1.9 follow-up.

## Context

- **Phase:** PR-review (Epic 2 close-out, post-implementation).
- **Epic:** Epic 2 — Sandboxed Execution Environment (devbox); PR #230 Open, awaiting review-feedback resolution + merge.
- **Epic Branch (target of fix iterations):** `feat/epic-2-packaged-devbox` (PR #230 head).
- **Working Branch (this branch):** `chore/pr-230-review` — IP + RALPH.md only.
- **Story:** _(no story — review iteration)._
- **Story State:** _(no story — synthesizer mode)._
- **PR:** #230 **Open**. Iter-8 landed `d3aecde` on feat-2 (2.7 AC3 docker-exec Change Log v1.7; pre-push CI gate green via REST step-2 LADDER fallback after graphql i/o-timeout flake). feat-2 pushed (`7390020..d3aecde`); chore-branch push retry pending in this commit. Carry-forward unpushed (chore-only): `7308978` (iter-6c retry-success record) + `44aa8f8` (iter-7 prune) + `<this-commit>`.

## Halt criterion

When QUEUE empty AND `gh pr view 230 --json reviews,comments` shows all PR threads resolved → write `EPIC_DONE` halt with `note` field per § Halt § Autonomy guardrail: `echo '{"reason":"EPIC_DONE","epic":2,"pr":230,"note":"PR review feedback addressed"}' > "$RALPH_BASE_DIR/halt"`. Do NOT introduce new halt reasons.
